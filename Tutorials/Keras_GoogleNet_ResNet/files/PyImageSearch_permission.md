Hi Daniele,
Thanks for reaching out, I appreciate it! And yes, please feel free to use the code in your project.
If you could attribute the code to the book that would be perfect :-)
Thank you!

Hi Adrian.

...

Can I use part of your code in my tutorials?
In case of positive answer, what header do you want to see in the python files?

...

Just to be sure to be fair from one side (citing all the fantastic work you have done)
and having no legal issues from another sideâ€¦

With kind regards,
